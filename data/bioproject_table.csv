1336731	PRJNA1336731	2025/09/30 00:00	Symbiotic state modulates microbiome recovery following depletion in a facultatively symbiotic cnidarian	This study explored microbiome depletion and recovery following antibiotic treatment in symbiotic and aposymbiotic Exaiptasia pallida, a facultatively symbiotic sea anemone. We used 16S gene sequencing of the bacterial microbiome to characterize taxa during recovery following antibiotic treatment. We characterized the host molecular response to microbiome depletion and recovery using whole-animal gene expression profiling and Western blotting of the innate immune transcription factor NF-kappaB. This study reveals dynamics of microbiome recovery following depletion and the influence of microbiome community members on host gene expression, providing a foundation for work for future research involving pairwise interactions between beneficial microorganisms and cnidarian hosts		
1089063	PRJNA1089063	2024/03/18 00:00	Exaiptasia diaphana strain:F003 | isolate:F003 Genome sequencing and assembly	Coral reefs depend upon a functional symbiosis between cnidarian hosts and unicellular dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodinidaceae. Exaiptasia sp., a genus of globally distributed sea anemone, have become an important model system for cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbioses and the role of the microbiome in affecting metaorganism biology and adaptive capacity. Here we sequenced and assembled the genome of the Aiptasia model, strain F003.	Exaiptasia diaphana	F003
988282	PRJNA988282	2023/06/28 00:00	Microbiome of Exaiptasia diaphana and Berghia stephanieae fed and under different starvation conditions	The cladobranch Berghia stephanieae is able to incorporate photobionts of its food source Exaiptasia diaphana and keeps these photobionts active for up to 5 days. Although both species are well-studied model organisms in the realm of mollusc-dinoflagellate ecology, the microbiome and its contribution to the photosymbiosis of the slugs has long been overlooked. Here we present the first microbiome analysis of freshly fed B. stephanieae and its food source under different one-week starvation conditions (low light, high light and dark).

630329	PRJNA630329	2020/05/04 00:00	Assessment of a ROS-targeted bacterial probiotic aimed at improving thermal tolerance in the coral model, the sea anemone Exaiptasia diaphana	Probiotic inoculation is one of several interventions currently being developed with the aim of increasing climate resilience in corals. Inspired by the oxidative stress theory of coral bleaching, we investigated whether a probiotic comprised of bacteria isolated from the coral model, Exaiptasia diaphana, and designed to scavenge free radicals could improve thermal tolerance of this anemone. We tested our probiotic alongside low free radical scavenging and no-inoculum control treatments under ambient and elevated temperature conditions but found no evidence for improved thermal tolerance. Changes in the relative abundance of anemone-associated Labrenzia provided strong evidence for probiotic integration in the E. diaphana microbiome. Uptake of other probiotic members was inconsistent and probiotic members did not persist in the anemone microbiome over time. Consequently, the failure of probiotic inoculation to confer improved thermal tolerance may have been due to the absence of probiotic bacteria for the full duration the experiment. Importantly, there were no apparent physiological impacts on the holobiont following inoculation, thus showing that shifting the abundance of naturally occurring anemone microbiome members is not detrimental. Given the frequency of coral bleaching events, without urgent intervention to achieve coral resilience to climate change, coral reefs will not survive. This study will therefore be invaluable for future bacterial bioengineering approaches.	Exaiptasia diaphana	AIMS2-4
592182	PRJNA592182	2019/11/27 00:00	Comparison of gene expression in Exaiptasia pallida aposymbiotic cells and cells containing Microchloropsis gaditana	Emergence of the symbiotic lifestyle fostered the immense diversity of all ecosystems on Earth, but symbiosis plays a particularly remarkable role in marine ecosystems. Photosynthetic dinoflagellate endosymbionts power reef ecosystems by transferring vital nutrients to their coral hosts. The mechanisms driving this symbiosis, specifically those which allow hosts to discriminate between beneficial symbionts and pathogens, are not well understood. Here, we uncover that host immune suppression is key for dinoflagellate endosymbionts to avoid elimination by the host using a comparative, model systems approach. Unexpectedly, we find that the clearance of non-symbiotic microalgae occurs by non-lytic expulsion (vomocytosis) and not intracellular digestion, the canonical mechanism used by professional immune cells to destroy foreign invaders. We provide evidence that suppression of TLR signalling by targeting the conserved MyD88 adapter protein has been co-opted for this endosymbiotic lifestyle, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily ancient mechanism exploited to facilitate symbiotic associations ranging from coral endosymbiosis to the microbiome of vertebrate guts. Overall design: The gene expression profiles of aposymbiotic endodermal cells and cells containing M. gaditana obtained 24 - 48 hours after uptake in Aiptaisia larvae were compared. In addition to GEO accession: GSE140173	Exaiptasia diaphana

576020	PRJNA576020	2019/10/05 00:00	Exaiptasia diaphana from the Great Barrier Reef: a valuable resource for coral symbiosis research	The sea anemone, Exaiptasia diaphana, commonly known as Exaiptasia pallida or Aiptasia pallida, has become increasingly popular as a model for cnidarian-microbiome symbiosis studies due to its relatively rapid growth, ability to reproduce sexually and asexually, and symbiosis with diverse prokaryotes and the same microalgal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) as its coral relatives. Clonal E. diaphana strains from Hawaii, the Atlantic Ocean, and Red Sea are now established for use in research. We introduce Great Barrier Reef (GBR)-sourced E. diaphana strains as additions to the model repertoire. Data provided here includes sequences of the 18S rRNA gene to confirm the anemones as E. diaphana, with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealing four distinct genotypes. Exaiptasia-specific inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)-derived sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers and gene loci data are also provided.	Exaiptasia diaphana	AIMS1-4

Our aim was to assess whether microbiome changes could be linked to an increase in thermotolerance at high salinities and what bacterial taxa are subject to change.	Exaiptasia diaphana
